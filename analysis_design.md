# Project Guide - Analysis and Design Buyer Persona, Brand Guide, and Marketing Plan

**"The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself."**
**- Peter Drucker Quote** 

**"Know your customers as you know yourself, and you'll craft a product they cannot refuse."**

## Step 1: Analysing and Designing your Buyer Persona
In the initial phase of this module, your task is to leverage the insights derived from your competitive analysis and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to shape a comprehensive buyer persona for your chosen business. This persona represents your ideal customer and provides insights into their needs, behaviors, and motivations.

In building your buyer persona, ensure you infuse the BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing) strategy and the six methods of persuasion (Reciprocity, Commitment and Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity). Grasping how these principles interact with your buyer persona will help shape a product/service that is compelling and persuasive, prompting your audience to action.

## Step 2: Crafting Your Brand Guide
Once your buyer persona has been well-defined, the next stage is to develop a brand guide. This guide forms the cornerstone of your business's identity, marrying your chosen brand archetype with the brand's aesthetic elements and messaging (mission, vision, and values).

When constructing your brand guide, consider how your chosen brand archetype aligns with your buyer persona. This archetype should reflect the motivations and values of your buyer persona, guiding your brand's communications and interactions.

To ensure a comprehensive and effective brand guide, consider the use of fonts, colors, imagery, and vocabulary that resonate with your buyer persona. Also, ensure that the six methods of persuasion and BANT principles are integrated into your brand's communication and interactions. This will result in a brand that is not only visually consistent but also psychologically engaging, fostering customer loyalty.

## Step 3: Developing Your Marketing Plan (Sales Funnel / Customer Journey)
In the third phase of this module, your task is to devise a marketing plan that masterfully navigates your prospective customers through the sales funnelâ€”from their initial awareness to sustained loyalty.

This marketing plan should not exist in isolation but should be a natural extension of your buyer persona and brand guide. It needs to leverage the BANT framework and the six methods of persuasion at each stage of the sales funnel. This will ensure your strategies and tactics for attracting, engaging, and retaining customers are deeply rooted in your understanding of your buyer persona and consistent with your brand guide.

## The Final Proposal - [Week 3](proposal.md)
In week 3, the culmination of your diligent work will manifest as a comprehensive business proposal. This proposal will present an integrated view of your buyer persona, brand guide, and marketing plan, supported by a 5-minute video pitch.

This proposal will demonstrate how you've skillfully applied principles of brand archetypes, SWOT analysis, GIT collaboration, strategic thinking, and team collaboration. It will show how you've implemented the BANT principles and the six methods of persuasion through your buyer persona, brand guide, and marketing plan, illustrating your deep understanding of these concepts and their practical application.

Remember: This project is a progressive task, with each step building upon the previous one. Currently, your focus should be on creating a unique online experience aligned with your brand guide and resonating with your buyer persona. As we advance to the next phase, your focus will shift to implementing these strategies and bringing your proposal to fruition.
