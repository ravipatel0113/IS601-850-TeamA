#### About Peet's Coffee

Peet's Coffee is a specialty coffee roaster and retailer that was founded in 1966 in Berkeley, California, by Alfred Peet. A Dutch immigrant, Alfred moved to the United States in 1955. Inspired by the European coffee tradition, he opened his first coffee store in Berkeley, California, with the goal of introducing Americans to freshly roasted, high-quality coffee. The company is known for its focus on sourcing and roasting high-quality coffee beans to deliver a premium coffee experience to its customers.

They source Arabica coffee beans from around the world, including regions such as Latin America, East Africa, and Indonesia. The company's master roasters carefully roast the beans in small batches to achieve the desired flavors and aromas.

Peet's offers a wide range of coffee products to cater to various tastes and preferences. They have a selection of signature blends, including Major Dickason's Blend, Garuda Blend, and French Roast. In addition to blends, Peet's offers single-origin coffees that highlight the distinct characteristics of specific regions. They also provide a variety of specialty beverages such as lattes, cappuccinos, and cold brew.

Peet's Coffee operates a network of retail stores primarily located in California and the East Coast of the United States. Their stores often feature a warm and inviting atmosphere, with knowledgeable baristas who are passionate about coffee. Peet's aims to provide a personalized customer experience and create a sense of community within their stores.

Over the years, Peet's Coffee has expanded its operations through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. In 2012, they acquired a majority stake in Intelligentsia Coffee, a specialty coffee roaster and retailer. In the same year, they also acquired Stumptown Coffee Roasters, another well-known specialty coffee brand. These acquisitions allowed Peet's to diversify its offerings and expand its reach.

Peet's Coffee has partnerships with various retail establishments, including grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants. They supply their coffee products to these partners, extending their brand presence beyond their standalone stores. Peet's also offers online sales, allowing customers to purchase their coffee beans, beverages, and merchandise through their website.
