# Project Overview

## Project Scenario

Imagine your team as part of a leading web development agency. Your task is to win over a significant client by delivering a tailor-made proposal in the form of a website and video proposal that includes a detailed buyer persona, brand guide, and marketing plan. The proposal should reflect each stage of the customer journey - from initial contact to final conversion. This project requires you to leverage the BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline) framework to target the right customers effectively.  You will need to prepare a 5 minute video proposal to explain your brand concept for their digital marketing strategy to the client, since they are soliciting proposals from other agencies and are very busy.  You can just include the video in the GITHub Repo and link to it or you can use YouTube and make it unlistted and embed itt in the website.

## Project Twist - Prepare for a Mass Layoff

An intriguing aspect of this project is the **"Mass Layoff"** scenario. At the conclusion of this part of the project, your team will need to **"lay off"** one member. This **"laid-off"** member will then **"apply"** for a new **"job"** with other groups, going through a resume submission and interview process. They should be prepared to discuss their contributions and justify their fit into a new group. This exercise emphasizes the importance of significant contributions from all team members.  Your group will be **hiring** someone as well, so you will get a new replacement.  The documentation you make for the project will help you get them up to speed because your team will be under a tight timeline to get the final website finished.  A signficant aspect of your final grade will be having documentation that aligns with the finished website.
