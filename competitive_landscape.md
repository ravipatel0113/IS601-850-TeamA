_"Good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas."_ - Steve Jobs

_"Just don't steal from your classmates, or I'll fail you."_ - Professor Williams

## Step 1: Research and Analysis
Your primary objective in this phase is to analyze three businesses that compete with your selected business type. Your examination should encompass their brand archetype presentation, sales funnel structure, BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing) strategy, and six persuasion methods.

Remember, your research should provide valuable insights into how these businesses incorporate their brand archetypes, sales funnel stages, BANT strategies, and persuasion methods into their broader strategy. These findings will contribute to your SWOT analysis for this module, providing a comprehensive perspective of your chosen business within its competitive landscape.

After conducting your research, consolidate all your findings into a comprehensive report, a valuable resource for future stages of this project.

## Step 2: SWOT Analysis and Strategic Plan
Building on your research insights, your next step is to construct a competitive landscape SWOT analysis. This analysis should offer insights into your competitors' tactics, informing your own unique strategy for attracting customers.

Your SWOT analysis should include the brand archetype, the sales funnel, the BANT framework, and the six persuasion methods. You will use this SWOT analysis to develop your buyer persona, marketing strategy (sales funnel/customer journey), and branding guide in the following stages.

For now, focus on gaining a thorough understanding of the competitive landscape and creating a strategic plan based on your research insights. Avoid jumping ahead to developing your own business persona or branding guide.
