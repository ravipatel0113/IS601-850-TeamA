## Team Collaboration Report - Requirements 

The team collaboration report should include a table of Git pull requests with columns for:

- Pull Request Title
- Description
- Assignee
- Story Points
- Date Assigned
- Date Completed

Example:

| Pull Request Title | Description | Assignee | Story Points | Date Assigned | Date Completed |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Homepage design | Design the homepage layout | Alice | 5 | MM/DD/YYYY | MM/DD/YYYY |
| Contact form | Implement a contact form on the Contact Us page | Bob | 3 | MM/DD/YYYY | MM/DD/YYYY |

## Project Contribution Percent Calculation

The project contribution percentage for each team member can be calculated based on the sum of story points assigned to each member. Here's an example:

If the total number of story points for a week is 20, and Alice completed tasks with 5 story points, Bob completed tasks with 7 story points, and Charlie completed tasks with 8 story points, then:

- Alice's contribution percent: (5 / 20) * 100 = 25%
- Bob's contribution percent: (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%
- Charlie's contribution percent: (8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

Please include this information in your group activity report for a clear understanding of individual contributions.

## Meeting Attendance

To verify attendance and active participation during the online meetings, please attach a screenshot documenting the meeting attendees. This ensures that everyone is present, contributing, and collaborating effectively.

## Calculating Story Points

Story points are a measure of effort, complexity, and uncertainty involved in a task. To assign story points, you can use a modified version of the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on) to reflect the understanding that the effort doesn't increase linearly with complexity.

The numbers in this sequence reflect relative sizing of tasks, allowing your team to quickly categorize tasks into buckets without getting bogged down in determining the exact duration of each task.

- 1: Simple task (requires little effort and knowledge)
- 2: Slightly complex task
- 3: Moderately complex task
- 5: Complex task
- 8: Very complex task
- 13, 21, and so on: These larger numbers can be used for epic tasks that will be broken down into smaller tasks.

During your team meetings, discuss and agree on the story points for each task. The sum of all story points for the week gives you the total effort required for the week's tasks.
