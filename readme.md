**Unlike Previous Assignments I will keep this repository as the "master" so that  I can update t for everyone over the next 3 weeks.  You will still use GitHub classroom; however, you will be writing your own tests and maintaining this repository for the entire project that will span the next 3 weeks**

## Project Learning Objectives

This project is designed to cultivate two fundamental skills:

1. **Mastering GIT Collaboration**: Gain practical experience in GIT collaboration, a vital skill among developers, through the process of creating pull requests, merging code, and maintaining effective team communication. 

2. **Strategic Business and Technology Thought Process**: Your team will architect a detailed website plan, which integrates branding, marketing, and sales concepts, which will serve as a blueprint for a successful website in your final project.

By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of what your final project needs in terms of design and function. More importantly, you will gain valuable experience in professional processes and GIT collaboration. This exercise emulates real-world situations, preparing you for future professional challenges.

## Important Considerations for Grading 

- You are going to receive 50% of your points for your collaboration reports and 50% of your points from the quality of your persona, branding, sales funnel, and video in week 3.  Week 1 and 2 will be graded on a complete / incomplete basis while week 3 will be graded in detail with feedback from the instructor.

- You should seek feedback from the instructor by posting any questions to the discussiion board as you are doing the project in week 1 and 2, so that your all set for development in week 3.

## Peer Feedback and Discussion

Participate in the Canvas discussion board to share your work and receive constructive feedback from your peers and the instructor. The exchange of honest yet respectful feedback is crucial to our collective learning journey.
